Australia's second largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, announced a 19.5 percent rise in net profit for the 1995/96 year on Tuesday, but warned that fierce competition would flatten profits in the year ahead.
"Everywhere you look and in every market we're in there's a lot of margin pressure," Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss told a news conference after the profit announcement.
"It will be tough to make a rise," he said when asked if profits for the year to September 30, 1997 would be flat.  
Westpac reported a net profit of A$1.132 billion for the year to September 30, 1996, up 19.5 percent on 1994/95, but this disguised a flat profit in the second half and was boosted by a sharp drop in bad debt charges for year.
Bad debt charges fell to A$121 million in 1995/96, down sharply from A$330 million in 1994/95, a fall which Westpac said contributed about A$200 million to the 12 percent rise in pre-tax and abnormals profit to A$1.389 billion.
Joss said competition from non-bank mortgage originators in the housing loan sector was a key factor pressuring margins.  
Mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and RAMS have taken over 10 percent of the mortgage market from the big banks including Westpac over the last two years, dragging home loan margins down from over 300 basis points to just over 200 points. Joss said Westpac would look to boost its own mortgage origination programme to help compete against the non-banks and support its margins.
Westpac has already launched one issue of securitised mortgages worth A$340 million, the first of the major banks to do so.  
Joss said Westpac planned to multiply the size of such issues in the current year.
"The real key for us will be to try to manage our balance sheet, have more assets off balance sheets, more securitising of lower margin assets," he said.
"We just did one near the tail end of the (1995/96) year, A$340 million, so we would expect to see quite a bit more in the year ahead," Joss said.
When asked how much more than A$340 million, he said: "Multiples of A$340 million."
Even then, Westpac would struggle to maintain its margin.  
Westpac reported in its accounts for the year that the group's net margin had fallen to 370 basis points over the whole 1995/96 year, down from 380 basis points over 1994/95.
Joss said the fall was already apparent towards the end of the year to September.
"At the tail end of the year, it's actually less than what you would have seen for the year," Joss said.
He acknowledged Westpac would find it difficult to keep that margin from falling from 370 points.
Given the margin pressure, Westpac would continue to focus on increasing transaction and other fees to compensate.  
"In such an environment, maintenance of overall net earnings growth will depend increasingly on attaining improvements in fee income generation, particularly non lending-related fees and on improved efficiency of operations," Joss said in an earlier statement.
He told the news conference he would like to see Westpac's efficiency ratio, which measures expenses to income, fall below 60 percent from the 62.6 percent evident in 1995/96.  
This ratio worsened during the year from 60.6 percent in 1994/95, due largely to the costs of acquiring and restructuring the Western Australian-based Challenge Bank and Trust Bank of New Zealand.
Joss said rationalisations throughout Westpac over the next two years would help to lower costs, improve efficiency and therefore compensate somewhat for the slimmer margins.
The bearish comments from Joss helped Westpac close 15 cents lower at A$7.05.
