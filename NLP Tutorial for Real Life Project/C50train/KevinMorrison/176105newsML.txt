Building materials, aluminium and sugar group CSR Ltd is expected to report on Monday a net profit before abnormals of between A$146 million and A$160 million for the six months to September 30, analysts said on Friday.
On October 14, CSR said that its 1996/97 first half profit was likely to be 20 percent lower, with the full year down by the same amount if the first half trend continued.  
Analysts have cut their 1996/97 year profit estimates for CSR after last month's profit warning. Annual forecasts now range between A$250 million to A$272 million, compared with around the A$300 million level before the warning.
CSR reported a nine percent fall in net profit before abnormals of A$193.4 million in the 1995/96 first half.
Sean Cooney, a building materials analyst at ANZ Securities, forecast CSR to report a first half pre-abnormals net profit of A$156.6 million. Cooney forecast CSR to report an annual net profit before abnornals of between A$255-A$260 million.  
Greg Burns at BZW Australia forecast A$160 million for the half and A$260 million for the year to March 31, 1997.
Mark Cotton, building materials analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, forecast CSR to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$160 million for the half and A$272 million for the year.
Michael Brown at McIntosh Securities forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$146 million for the half and around A$250 million for the year. Brown has a hold recommendation on CSR.  
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett's building materials analyst Fabian Babich forecast CSR to report a pre-abnornmal net profit between A$145 million and A$150 million for the half and about A$260 million for the year.
Analysts said the second half for the Sydney-based group was cyclically lower than the first half, as the Australian housing industry slows over December and January for the holiday season. CSR said last month intense price competition and low volumes continued in the Australian building products market were some of the main reasons for the expected profit fall.  
It said in the United States its operation was achieving record profits, but the aluminium group which was a strong performer last year would achieve lower earnings in 1996/97 due to falling metal prices.
It also said sugar profits for the year would be close to that achieved last year despite lower raw sugar prices.
CSR reported a net profit after abnormals of A$330.8 million in 1995/96, compared with A$392.60 million in 1994/95.  
Analysts are forecasting CSR's profit to start to turnaround in the 1997/98 year, on the back of an improving domestic housing market in calendar 1997. The local housing market has been in the doldrums since the end of 1994.
BZW's Burns said the housing market was still on for a turnaround in 1997. "Building approvals seem to be improving from where they were, housing affordability has improved immeasurably, all we need now is a bit of confidence,"
At 11.15 a.m. (0015 GMT), CSR shares were a cent down at A$4.30. They have traded between A$4.06 and A$4.72 this year.
