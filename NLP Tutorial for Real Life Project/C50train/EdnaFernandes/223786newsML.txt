Stagecoach Plc, the bus to rail operator which has seen its shareprice double in under a year, said on Thursday it expected ongoing progress in dividend growth after reporting record profits of 47 million stg.
Keith Cochrane, finance director, told Reuters "We expect ongoing progress in our second half dividend," even after raising the interim payout by 43 percent to three pence. But he pointed out that the first dividend reflected the 15 million stg profit from the sale of its stake in Strathclyde Buses.
