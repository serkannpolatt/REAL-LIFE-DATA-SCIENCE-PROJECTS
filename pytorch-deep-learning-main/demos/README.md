# FoodVision Demos
The `.zip` files contained in this folder contain the files for creating the FoodVision Mini and FoodVision Big demos.

The code to create these can be found in [09. PyTorch Model Deployment](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/).

Each `.zip` folder contains: 
* `model.py` - a file defining the model architecture used for the demo.
* `app.py` - a file defining the Gradio demo application.
* `*.pth` - a trained PyTorch model file with the same architecture as in `model.py`.
* `requirements.txt` - a list of required packages for deploying the app.
* `examples/` - a folder containing various image examples to try with the demo.

You can see a deployed version of each demo on HuggingFace Spaces:
