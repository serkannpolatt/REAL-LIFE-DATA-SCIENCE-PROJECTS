Toronto-Dominion Bank extended the run of record Canadian bank profits on Thursday with a 15 percent jump in 1996 earnings and a dividend hike for its shareholders.
Canada's fifth largest bank said net income climbed to C$914 million in the year ended October 31 from C$794 million in 1995. Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia earlier this week posted record full-year earnings.
The strong results prompted TD Bank to boost its quarterly dividend by C$0.03 to C$0.28 a share.  
Bank of Nova Scotia raised its dividend by C$0.03 a share to C$0.37 a share on Wednesday.
TD Bank said its performance reflected strong growth in other income, with significant gains in investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses.
The bank's loan loss provision also sank to its lowest level in more than a decade.
"With a solid financial performance and progress in developing our businesses, TD had a positive impact on the Canadian economy in 1996," chairman and chief executive Richard Thomson said in a statement.  
Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 15.4 percent in 1996 from 14.3 percent last year.
The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates.
Earnings rose to C$0.79 a share in the fourth quarter ended October 31 from C$0.71 a share in the same period in 1995.
The consensus analysts' forecast was for C$0.79 a share in the fourth quarter.
"They were dead on expectations. The dividend increase was also expected," said Hugh Brown, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Inc.  
Analysts said the revised loan loss provision was a surprise. The bank cut its 1996 provision to C$152 million from a previous third-quarter estimate of C$170 million and from C$180 million in 1995.
Net impaired loans in the fourth quarter fell C$95 million to C$344 million. "This decline was largely due to improvement in real estate loans to corporate borrowers," the bank said.
Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances dropped to 0.4 percent at year end. TD stock was up 0.80 to 37.65 on turnover of 821,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  
TD  hit a 52-week high of 38.10 earlier in the session.
TD president Charles Baillie said Canada's low interest rates should boost consumer confidence and economic activity in 1997. That in turn was expected to increase demand for the bank's investment products.
"With the acceleration of growth in investment banking, brokerage, mutual funds, investment management and electronic banking services, TD is positioned to perform well in this environment," said Baillie.
