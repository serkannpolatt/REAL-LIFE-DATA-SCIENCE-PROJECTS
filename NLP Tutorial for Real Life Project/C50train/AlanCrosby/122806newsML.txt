Boris Becker withdrew from the Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury, while top seed Goran Ivanisevic crashed out to Czech Petr Korda 7-6 6-2.
Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist at the Wimbledon championships this year, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm.
"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening," ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said.
On Wednesday Becker had held his wrist several times during his 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's absence has set back his bid for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot.
Ivanisevic, who has already qualified for the tour finale, lives and dies by the serve. 
But he was outgunned by Korda who served 10 aces and only one double fault, while Ivanisevic managed only nine aces along with five double faults.
"He surprised me the way he played, he served well and returned very well. I double-faulted at 5-5 in the tie break which hurt," said Ivanisevic.
"I didn't return well, I didn't take any chances on his second serve. I didn't know whether to stay back or come in and when you're not sure what to do then it's no good."
Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink.
Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions.
