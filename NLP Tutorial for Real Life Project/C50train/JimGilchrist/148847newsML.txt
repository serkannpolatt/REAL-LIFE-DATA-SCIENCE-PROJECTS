The chairman of Hong Kong freight forwarding company Baltrans Ltd, Anthony Lau, said he expects to enjoy considerable synergy and economies of scale following the acquisition of a majority stake this summer in a Los Angeles competitor, Fond Group.
"As yet there is no integration of the companies, which are still operating on a parallel basis, but as time goes on we will enjoy economies of scale and expect to see further growth," he added.
Baltrans is well positioned in Asia while Fond is well placed in the US west coast, "so additional synergy is there," Lau said.
Baltrans completed the HK$32.2 million deal for a 67.4 per cent stake in the Fond Group in July, Lau told Reuters in a telephone interview from his Kowloon office.
Fond specialises in shipping cargo from Hong Kong to the west coast of America and its acquisition is aimed at increasing the overall profitability of the Baltrans group on trans-Pacific segments, Lau said.
Baltrans added the Fond Group includes Fondair Express (HK), Fondocean Express (HK) and Fondexpress (USA) which have a combined turnover of around HK$300 million. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
