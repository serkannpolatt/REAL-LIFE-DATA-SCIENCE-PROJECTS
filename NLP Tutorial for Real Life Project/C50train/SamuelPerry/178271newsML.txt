Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc plans this week to unveil a series of advances in its marketing of enhanced video and audio technologies.
On Monday, the company will launch a deal with Toshiba Corp's Toshiba America Information Systems unit to deliver what will be among the first DVD-ROM products to hit the retail market, Chief Executive Bill Schroeder said.
Diamond will also announce new proprietary 3-D audio software and plans for moving into the market for machines running Microsoft Corp's Windows NT system.  
On Tuesday, the San Jose, Calif. maker of multimedia accelerators, modems and adapters also plans to launch a new plug-and-play video conferencing product, including a color camera and a microphone, at an estimated retail price of $399.
Amid the flurry of introductions ahead of the annual Comdex computer industry trade show beginning November 17, Schroeder told Reuters in an interview the company is on track to increase revenues and margins in its current fourth quarter.
