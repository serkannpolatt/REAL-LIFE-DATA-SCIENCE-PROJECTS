British Airways World Cargo (BAWC) is to employ a fourth weekly freighter between Hong Kong and London from next year, BAWC's regional cargo manager Pacific, Chris Humphrey said.
"We will definitely be moving forward with a fourth freighter. We are very bullish about the prospects for Hong Kong and Chinese economic growth. There's definitely a growing market here and next year's handover from a cargo point of view is immaterial. Other concerns such as US-Chinese trade relations have a much greater impact," Humphrey told Reuters in an interview at the British flag carrier's Hong Kong regional headquarters.
British Airways currently flies three Boeing 747 freighters a week between Hong Kong and London Gatwick which are wet leased from Atlas Air Inc. Denver-based Atlas uses converted passenger 747's to fly for several major airlines on aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) long term, wet-lease contracts which BA says it is happy to continue because no capital costs are incurred.
The cargo executive said statistics proved how strong the Hong Kong market is for BAWC. Humphrey said statistics of all Association of European Airlines (AEA) carriers in the Asia Pacific Region showed BAWC enjoyed an 18.5 percent increase in market share between January and July measured by Freight Tonne Kilometres (FTK). The traffic average for AEA carriers, which included Air France and Swissair, both to and from the region was 8.2 per cent, he said.
He also said freight tonnage from Hong Kong to BA's world-wide network in the first half of the financial year between April and September increased by 31 per cent.
"That's a pretty dramatic increase which is indicative of the market's strength," Humphrey said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
