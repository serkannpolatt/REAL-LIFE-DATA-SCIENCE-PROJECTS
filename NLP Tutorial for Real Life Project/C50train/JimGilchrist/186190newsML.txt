The Hong Kong Shippers' Council is urging the government to tell airlines that a fuel surcharge on air cargo rates is illegal, the council's executive director Clement Yeung told Reuters.
Cargo managers from major airlines operating to Europe met in the territory on October 31 and some agreed to raise ex-Hong Kong cargo rates by HK80 cents per kilo from November 4 to try to offset increased jet fuel prices.
The Hong Kong Shippers' Council said it had written to the Civil Aviation Department urging it to outlaw the surcharge.
"We are reasonable people. We don't necessarily object to each and every increase but we feel the airlines should follow the rules by obtaining approval. Their case should be supported by facts and figures," Yeung said.
"In this case, it seems only a few airlines have decided to impose the surcharge. Others have not followed which begs the question: What is Hong Kong going to do about it and if airlines should be allowed to keep their surcharge? If they are, then it is a gross injustice to shippers and freight forwarders. The airlines should abide by the book and the governments should tell them it is illegal," Yeung said.
The council represents 15 of the leading trade associations in the territory including the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association.
The Federation of Asia Pacific Air Cargo Agents (FAPAA) is also reported to be opposing the fuel surcharge. A report in the South China Morning Post quoted its chairman Bernard Angeles as saying the airlines' surcharge bid might fail because they had not applied for approval from Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department which he said was required by law.
