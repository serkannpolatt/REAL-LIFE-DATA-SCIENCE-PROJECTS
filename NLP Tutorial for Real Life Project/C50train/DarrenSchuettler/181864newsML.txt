Stock in Canada's big banks tumbled on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday after a Canadian brokerage cut its recommendations on the high-flying bank group.
CIBC Wood Gundy, a unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, cut its ratings on four of the so-called Big Six banks. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the six major banks, received the only buy recommendation.
"We are lowering our recommendations on the group of Canadian bank stocks, moving from three buys to only one buy," said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell.
Canadian bank stocks have soared to all-time highs in recent months, with Toronto's bank index up 46 percent in 1996.
But the group's valuation multiples are now averaging 1.7 times book value -- closing the gap between Canadian bank stocks and their U.S. counterparts, Maxwell said in a report to institutional investors.
Toronto's financial services group plummeted 145 points, or 2.7 percent, in heavy trading on Tuesday.
Bank of Montreal, which Maxwell reduced to hold from accumulate, fell C$1.55 ($1.16) to C$42.15 ($31.63) on 1.5 million shares.
Bank of Nova Scotia dropped C$1.85 ($1.38) to C$44.50 ($33.39) on 995,000 shares after Maxwell recommended investors reduce their Scotiabank holdings.
Royal Bank of Canada, which was cut to accumulate from buy, surrendered C$1.30 ($0.75) to C$46 ($34.52) on 2.9 million shares. Canada's biggest bank is the group's valuation leader with a multiple of 2.0 times book value, Maxwell said.
CIBC dropped C$1.70 ($1.27) to C$57.25 ($43) on 700,000 shares. Maxwell did not assign a ranking to CIBC.
Toronto-Dominion Bank sank C$1.15 (86 cents) to C$33.40 ($25) on volume of 1.3 million shares after it was lowered to accumulate from buy.
"Of the five largest banks, our top pick would remain TD (Toronto-Dominion), since it is most likely to continue to exercise its share repurchase programme, even at current multiples, reflecting its superior capital strength," Maxwell said.
National Bank of Canada fell 55 cents Canadian (41 cents) to C$13.35 ($10) on 1.05 million shares despite having the only buy recommendation of the group.
But some stock strategists remained bullish on Canadian banks. They said the group was still popular among foreign investors seeking to jump into the Canadian market, lured by interest rates at 40-year lows and a recovering economy.
"Foreigners are attracted to Canadian investments and one of the best areas they can participate in is the banking sector," said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities.
