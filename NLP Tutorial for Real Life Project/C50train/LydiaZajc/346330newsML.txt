The Toronto stock market joined a rally in bonds and finished stronger on Friday, resisting a late session downturn in New York and weakness in heavyweight gold stocks.
Toronto's key 300 Composite Index rose 24.48 points to close at 6109.58. About 105 million shares changed hands worth C$1.48 billion ($1.1 billion).
"It's the strength in the bond market and the bill market," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
North American bonds rallied after U.S. gross domestic product data released early Friday suggested inflation is not accelerating. The data eased fears of higher U.S. interest rates following next week's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

The strong side was led by retail, pipelines, forestry products and consumer products.
