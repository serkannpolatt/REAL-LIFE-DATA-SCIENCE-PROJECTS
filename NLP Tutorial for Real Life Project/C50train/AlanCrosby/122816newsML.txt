Third seed Boris Becker withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury.
Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist during the third round at this year's Wimbledon, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm.
"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening," ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said.
On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. During the match he held his wrist several times.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's absence has set back his plan to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot in Hannover.
Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals in Ostrava with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink.
Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions.
Although Becker was ranked only third for Ostrava behind Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most fans wanted to watch him.
Barely 1,000 saw Ivanisevic's first round against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. A tournament record 10,000 watched Becker defeat Fetterlein, ranked 156.
Seventh seed Tim Henman reached the last eight with a 7-6 7-5 victory over British Davis Cup team mate Greg Rusedski.
