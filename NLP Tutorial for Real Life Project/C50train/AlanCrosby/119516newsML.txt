Third seed Boris Becker, fresh from his first title since injuring his wrist at Wimbledon, cruised to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein in the Czech Indoor Open on Wednesday.
Fifth seed Todd Martin also had an easy time in his second round match, downing Italian Cristiano Caratti 6-4 6-1, while eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach was not as fortunate, falling 6-4 6-2 to Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak.
A slightly tired-looking Becker, who won the CA Trophy in Vienna on Sunday, looked rusty at times, missing easy volleys. But his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes kept Fetterlein, ranked 129th in the world, permanently on the back foot.
"I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow," said Becker who needed just over an hour to defeat his opponent.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the ligament he tore in a third round match at Wimbledon forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
His return to form may be just enough to earn the 28-year-old a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. Becker currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hanover.
Martin, ranked 11th in the world, also had little trouble disposing of Caratti, needing just 49 minutes for his straight sets win.
For Ulihrach, meeting a Davis Cup team mate for the second consecutive day proved too much, as he put up little resistance to Novak.
The previous day Ulihrach beat Daniel Vacek, ranked one spot below him at 36th, but could not recapture the service return which propelled him into the second round against Novak, ranked 40th.
