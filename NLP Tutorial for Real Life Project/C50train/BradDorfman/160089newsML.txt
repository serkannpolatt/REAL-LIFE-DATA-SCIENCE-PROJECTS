Corporate financing for a downtown Detroit sports stadium complex is in place and land acquisition nearly complete, Mayor Dennis Archer said Friday.
"We believe that we are very, very close in making it happen," Archer said at a news conference. "If property has to be taken, by condemnation or eminent domain, we will move in a timely manner in the manner in which it will be needed."
Legislation pending in the Michigan Legislature could help facilitate the condemnation process, Archer said.  
Archer also said a deadline of 1700 EST Friday for the Detroit Tigers baseball team and Detroit Lions football team to make a commitment to the $505 million stadium complex was flexible.
Lions President William Clay Ford Jr. said after the news conference that Monday was the true deadline, as Wayne County voters will have to decide Tuesday whether to approve a tax on hotels and rental cars geared at raising $80 million for the complex.  
"We can't go to the voters without this," Ford said after the news conference, referring to a complete accounting of land on which the complex would be built.
The owner of a parcel that houses the Gem Theatre appears to be the major holdout, officials indicated.
"The one owner is a big problem at this point," said June West, press secretary to the Wayne County executive's office. "There's a price issue."
The owner of the parcel, Chuck Forbes, could not be reached for comment Friday. West said stadium negotiators and Forbes were meeting Friday.
