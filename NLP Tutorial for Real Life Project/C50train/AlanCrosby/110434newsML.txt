East European bourses were mostly higher this week with the Warsaw Stock Exchange leading the way, hitting a 30-month high before easing slightly on profit-taking.
Budapest, Zagreb, Bratislava, Ljubljana and Sofia also posted gains, while markets in Prague and Bucharest lost ground in listless trading.
The Central European Share Index (CESI), which measures the performance of Prague, Budapest and Warsaw blue-chip stocks, dipped 0.29 percent to 1,486.55 points.
WARSAW
Polish shares on Friday extended Thursday's falls due to profit-taking, after a four-session, 2.7-percent rise on the back of gains on western bourses.
Analysts said the market could slip below 14,800 points before picking up toward the middle of next week as firms release their September earnings reports.
"It looks like we'll have falls for a few sessions, with the first support line at 14,800 points possibly broken," said Grzegorz Pindur, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage.
The main market's all-share WIG index closed at 14,920.4 points, up 244.5 points or 1.7 percent from Friday's close.
PRAGUE
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to limp through October, yet to record an advancing session, with little hope in sight for a turnaround as investors shun a market plagued by a lack of transparency.
The PX50 index closed at 542.4 on Friday, down 13.1 points, or 2.36 percent.
"I think the budget first reading passing is too weak a signal but it is definitely positive. There are still structural problems to be solved before investors get more confident in this market," said Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings.
Foreign investors have long-complained that Czech capital markets are plagued by weak securities legislation that allows for secretive transactions. An estimated 70 percent of all market activity takes place off-market.
BUDAPEST
The Budapest Stock Exchange closed the week at an all-time high, boosted by the release of some positive macroeconomic figures. On Friday the BUX index closed at 3,639.68 points, up 31.67 from last Friday's close.
"Price rises were not very significant but they may mark the beginning of a modestly bullish trend," said Robert Agoston of Daewoo Securities. "These macroeconomic data triggered price increases."
Hungary released wide range of macroeconomic data this week, including the central bank's preliminary current account, trade gap, reserve and inflation data, in addition.
BRATISLAVA
The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) also suffered through another week of sluggish trading, though a jump on Friday appeared to bear out broker predictions of signs that activity was gradually reviving.
The 12-share SAX index fell through the 200 level at mid-week, but then rebounded slightly to close at 203.82 points on Friday, up from Monday's open at 200.32 points.
"We have witnessed some fresh players on our market over the past few days, and the good thing is that the ratio between foreign and domestic investor seems to be well-balanced," said Libor Briska of Creditanstalt.
BUCHAREST
Thin interest from retail investors, who dominate the bourse, drove most share prices down this week.
Two independent indices fell to year-lows at both weekly sessions as investors awaited fresh listings to the currently traded 13 stocks.
Last week, the bourse said 11 companies had applied for listing but did not say when they would join trading.
The VAB index fell 1.5 percent to 291.7 points on Thursday and the BIG index dipped 1.6 percent to 289.98 points.
SOFIA
Two corporate issues traded higher on the Bulgarian stock market this week amid low investor interest.
The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Index (RABSI) closed at 41.28 points, up 0.26 from last Thursday due to the rise of RIF' third issue and TBS Hotels second issue.
TIRANA
Tirana's Stock Exchange this week recorded a 100 million leks transaction in 364-day treasury bills on Monday but no bonds changed hands on Thursday.
The Savings Bank sold 100 million leks worth of 364-day T-Bills to the National Commercial Bank on Monday, the first of Tirana's Stock Exchange (TSE) two weekly sessions.
The finance ministry on Thursday offered 800 million leks worth of 91-day t-bills, 400 million leks of 182-day t-bills and one billion leks in 364-day t-bills.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks forged ahead throughout the week, ending mixed on Friday as selected hoteliers closed slightly lower after recording new highs during the week. Traders said growing supply will stabilise prices next week.
LJUBLJANA
Slovenian shares jumped 18.5 percent this week, pushing the index up 202.6 points to 1,299.70 as investors snapped up shares of newly-privatised companies. Traders said the market was likely to continue its recent bull run.
