Virgin Rail group, the rail division of Entrepreur Richard branson's Virgin Group, said on Friday it planned to spend 250 million stg on new rolling stock after announcing it has won the CrossCountry rail franchise.
Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, told Reuters  "Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million (stg) on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid." The order will be placed next year, with delivery starting in 20002. He also said the government subsidy in the first year of the 15 year franchise will be 115 million pounds.  
The 115 million subsidy will be payable to Virgin in the first year of the new operation and has been reduced from the 1996/97 subsidy level of 127 million. Whitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15 year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 milliong payment to the government.
It will refurbish the HST 125 diesel trains and pledges to increase train miles by 14 percent. "We will grow the service, we will not cut them." he said.
It plans to introduce a series of initiatives on the CrossCountry franchise, the first to be won by Virgin.
CrossCountry had 108 million stg in passenger revenues in the year to March 31. It employs 842 staff and covers services linking England, Scotland and Wales.
