Zeneca Group Plc set the scene for record profits on Tuesday, telling investors that its 1996 performance was expected to be in line with market expectations.
Analysts are forecasting a leap in pre-tax profit for the year to around 1.0 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) from 619 million pounds in 1995 when Zeneca unveils results on March 11.
With a strong set of results already factored into the share price, Zeneca stock settled back four pence to 1689-1/2 pence in early trading.
Bumper pharmaceutical sales will help to drive profits forward, with 1996 sales volumes likely to be ahead by around 14 percent year-on-year.
Sales of the group's biggest-selling product, cardiovascular drug Zestril, are tipped to rise at a similar rate to 1995's 12 percent growth, despite increased competition from rival Merck &amp; Co MRK.L 's Prinivil and Cozaar.
Established prostate cancer treatment Zoladex also "continued to grow strongly," Zeneca said, while a decline in sales of its ageing breast cancer product Nolvadex slowed.
In a quarterly trading statement, Zeneca highlighted the performance of new drugs, with sales of prostate treatment Casodex and Nolvadex back-up Arimidex beating expectations. The recent launch of a novel tablet asthma drug Accolate in the U.S. has "gone well," the group said.
Sales of agro-chemicals last year "were close" to the 14 percent rise reported at the nine-month stage, with record sales of herbicides and of the insecticide Karate.
Operating profits at the slimmed-down specialities business were likely to be above 1995 levels after "a particularly strong second-half performance," Zeneca said.
Full-year results will be affected by a 35 million reorganisation charge on speciality disposals, signalled at the half-year stage, while reorganisation of the seeds joint venture should cost Zeneca around 20 million pounds.
