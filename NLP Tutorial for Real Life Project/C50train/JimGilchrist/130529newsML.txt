Pilots in Hong Kong are becoming better connected thanks to the Internet, says the general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association, John Findlay.
The association says it is now giving each of its 700 members an e-mail address so they can stay in touch no matter where they are flying.
Findlay told Reuters in an interview that his members already find out what's happening by using a telephone modem to access the association's bulletin board. With 300 members based outside Hong Kong, the association says it's becoming increasingly popular. Committee members who are also airline pilots constantly flying all over the world also can stay in touch with union business via their laptop computers.
"We've had the bulletin board for two and half years now and its very well used. It's fairly sophisticated and updated daily so pilots can access our newsletter. It also has its other uses like a leisure forum and a 'for sale' site," Findlay said.
Now members will be able to send and receive messages by e_mail anywhere in the world and the eventual aim is to have a website page specifically for Hong Kong pilots, he said.
"It's the way to go," Findlay said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
