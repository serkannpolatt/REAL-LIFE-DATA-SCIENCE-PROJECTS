    "# 00. PyTorch Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can PyTorch be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the worlds largest technology companies such as [Meta (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as [OpenAI use PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/) to power research and bring machine learning to their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pytorch being used across industry and research](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/00-pytorch-being-used-across-research-and-industry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks ([PyTorch DevCon 2019](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE), [Tesla AI Day 2021](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2904)) about how Tesla use PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is also used in other industries such as argiculture to [power computer vision on tractors](https://medium.com/pytorch/ai-for-ag-production-machine-learning-for-agriculture-e8cfdb9849a1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning researchers love using PyTorch. And as of February 2022, PyTorch is the [most used deep learning framework on Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/trends), a website for tracking machine learning research papers and the code repositories attached with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch also helps take care of many things such as GPU acceleration (making your code run faster) behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you can focus on manipulating data and writing algorithms and PyTorch will make sure it runs fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if companies such as Tesla and Meta (Facebook) use it to build models they deploy to power hundreds of applications, drive thousands of cars and deliver content to billions of people, it's clearly capable on the development front too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover in this module\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is broken down into different sections (notebooks). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook covers important ideas and concepts within PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent notebooks build upon knowledge from the previous one (numbering starts at 00, 01, 02 and goes to whatever it ends up going to).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook deals with the basic building block of machine learning and deep learning, the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Topic** | **Contents** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **Introduction to tensors** | Tensors are the basic building block of all of machine learning and deep learning. |\n",
    "| **Creating tensors** | Tensors can represent almost any kind of data (images, words, tables of numbers). |\n",
    "| **Getting information from tensors** | If you can put information into a tensor, you'll want to get it out too. |\n",
    "| **Manipulating tensors** | Machine learning algorithms (like neural networks) involve manipulating tensors in many different ways such as adding, multiplying, combining. | \n",
    "| **Dealing with tensor shapes** | One of the most common issues in machine learning is dealing with shape mismatches (trying to mixed wrong shaped tensors with other tensors). |\n",
    "| **Indexing on tensors** | If you've indexed on a Python list or NumPy array, it's very similar with tensors, except they can have far more dimensions. |\n",
    "| **Mixing PyTorch tensors and NumPy** | PyTorch plays with tensors ([`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)), NumPy likes arrays ([`np.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)) sometimes you'll want to mix and match these. | \n",
    "| **Reproducibility** | Machine learning is very experimental and since it uses a lot of *randomness* to work, sometimes you'll want that *randomness* to not be so random. |\n",
    "| **Running tensors on GPU** | GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) make your code faster, PyTorch makes it easy to run your code on GPUs. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can can you get help?\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the materials for this course [live on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you run into trouble, you can ask a question on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/discussions) there too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the [PyTorch developer forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/), a very helpful place for all things PyTorch. "

And with a lower amount of storage, this generally results in faster computation and a smaller overall model. Mobile-based neural networks often operate with 8-bit integers, smaller and faster to run but less accurate than their float32 counterparts. For more on this, I'd read up about [precision in computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)).\n",

    "> **Exercise:** So far we've covered a fair few tensor methods but there's a bunch more in the [`torch.Tensor` documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), I'd recommend spending 10-minutes scrolling through and looking into any that catch your eye. Click on them and then write them out in code yourself to see what happens."

    "| Method | One-line description |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| [`torch.reshape(input, shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.reshape.html#torch.reshape) | Reshapes `input` to `shape` (if compatible), can also use `torch.Tensor.reshape()`. |\n",
    "| [`torch.Tensor.view(shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.view.html) | Returns a view of the original tensor in a different `shape` but shares the same data as the original tensor. |\n",
    "| [`torch.stack(tensors, dim=0)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.1/generated/torch.stack.html) | Concatenates a sequence of `tensors` along a new dimension (`dim`), all `tensors` must be same size. |\n",
    "| [`torch.squeeze(input)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.squeeze.html) | Squeezes `input` to remove all the dimenions with value `1`. |\n",
    "| [`torch.unsqueeze(input, dim)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.1/generated/torch.unsqueeze.html) | Returns `input` with a dimension value of `1` added at `dim`. | \n",

    "Because deep learning models (neural networks) are all about manipulating tensors in some way.

    "1. Documentation reading - A big part of deep learning (and learning to code in general) is getting familiar with the documentation of a certain framework you're using. We'll be using the PyTorch documentation a lot throughout the rest of this course. So I'd recommend spending 10-minutes reading the following (it's okay if you don't get some things for now, the focus is not yet full understanding, it's awareness):\n",
    "  * The documentation on [`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch-tensor).\n",
    "  * The documentation on [`torch.cuda`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/cuda.html#cuda-semantics).\n",
    "2. Create a random tensor with shape `(7, 7)`.\n",
    "3. Perform a matrix multiplication on the tensor from 2 with another random tensor with shape `(1, 7)` (hint: you may have to transpose the second tensor).\n",
    "4. Set the random seed to `0` and do 2 & 3 over again. The output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(tensor([[1.8542],\n",
    "         [1.9611],\n",

    "         [1.7989]]), torch.Size([7, 1]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Speaking of random seeds, we saw how to set it with `torch.manual_seed()` but is there a GPU equivalent? (hint: you'll need to look into the documentation for `torch.cuda` for this one)\n",
    "  * If there is, set the GPU random seed to `1234`.\n",
    "6. Create two random tensors of shape `(2, 3)` and send them both to the GPU (you'll need access to a GPU for this). Set `torch.manual_seed(1234)` when creating the tensors (this doesn't have to be the GPU random seed). The output should be something like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "7. Perform a matrix multiplication on the tensors you created in 6 (again, you may have to adjust the shapes of one of the tensors).\n",
    "8. Find the maximum and minimum values of the output of 7.\n",
    "9. Find the maximum and minimum index values of the output of 7.\n",
    "10. Make a random tensor with shape `(1, 1, 1, 10)` and then create a new tensor with all the `1` dimensions removed to be left with a tensor of shape `(10)`. Set the seed to `7` when you create it and print out the first tensor and it's shape as well as the second tensor and it's shape. The output should look something like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "tensor([[[[0.5349, 0.1988, 0.6592, 0.6569, 0.2328, 0.4251, 0.2071, 0.6297,\n",
