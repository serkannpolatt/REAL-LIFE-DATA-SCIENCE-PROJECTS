Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans Monday for a five-year "Big Bang" to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters the three main pillars of the reforms would be to make markets "free, fair and global" by the year 2001.
The moves would end fixed commissions for stockbrokers, increase the release of financial information and allow banks, securities houses and insurance companies to enter each others' now-protected areas.
"This is going to be Tokyo's 'Big Bang,'" Mitsuzuka said, referring to British financial reforms in 1986, which removed a myriad of barriers in the financial industry.
Analysts welcomed the move to sweep away rules that date back to the end of World War II, saying that Japan must reform in order to stop its slide as a world financial centre.
"Japanese banks and securities houses are left behind U.S. institutions in financial expertise and innovation," said Ken Okamura, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd.
Tight regulation in Japan's financial markets has only pushed lucrative business offshore to less regulated markets, he said.
Hashimoto formed a new Cabinet Thursday made up solely of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers, the first time the conservative, pro-business party has ruled on its own since being booted out of power in 1993.
Some pundits have wondered how serious Hashimoto and the LDP are about drastic deregulation, although others say the politically astute prime minister is well aware of the need to open Japanese markets to competition to ensure the economy flourishes in the 21st century.
"This is a very good objective, but getting there is going to be extremely difficult," said Brian Waterhouse, a James Capel Pacific analyst.
The securities industry is expected to be the hardest hit by the changes, and the nation's big banks are expected to face some bloodletting as well.
The reforms would bring Tokyo into line with rival centres in Europe and the United States, where liberalisation began in the 1960s and culminated in London's "Big Bang."
"We think this is the last opportunity to revitalise Tokyo's financial markets," a Finance Ministry official told reporters.
Here are the main points of the financial reform plansL:
To create freer markets:
-- Banks, securities houses and insurance companies should be allowed to enter each others' business areas.
-- Banks and other financial institutions should be allowed to deal in more products in a bid to meet investors' wide range of needs.
-- Japan will look into the liberalisation of financial market commission fees.
-- Participation in foreign exchange transactions, currently limited to banks authorised by the government, should be liberalised.
-- Considering the effective use of individual savings, which now total 1,200 trillion yen ($10.81 trillion).
To create fairer markets:
-- Financial institutions should be required to make satisfactory disclosure of information to investors and depositors and clarify relevant rules to make market participants responsible for their investment.
-- Market participants will be more severely punished if they violate the rules regarding their involvement in the markets.
To createe more internationalized markets:
-- Investment in financial derivatives -- securities derived from simpler financial instruments -- should be promoted in Japan by revising Japan's accounting system and relevant laws to meet global standards.
-- A supervisory system on a global scale should be established. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations is working on setting up up such a system. ($1=111 yen)
