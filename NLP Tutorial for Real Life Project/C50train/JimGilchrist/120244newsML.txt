American cargo carrier Evergreen International Airlines Inc said on Wednesday it has increased the number of flights from Hong Kong due of high trans-Pacific demand.
Evergreen has six weekly Boeing 747 freighter flights a week instead of four per week and said it can't keep up with current demand.
"All flights are absolutely full and if we had additional flights into Hong Kong we would have no problem filling them because there is a lot of freight being moved and a backlog is building up," said Evergreen's vice-president Kersti Krepp told Reuters.
The additional flights on Mondays are to both the U.S. east and west coast - Columbus, Ohio then onto New York and Los Angeles. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
