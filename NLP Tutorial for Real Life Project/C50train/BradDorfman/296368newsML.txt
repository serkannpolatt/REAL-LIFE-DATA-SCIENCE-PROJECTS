U.S. retailers reported overall sales near plan for the key December holiday shopping month Thursday, but results varied widely by store and sector with department stores appearing to take some market share from specialty stores.
"The major retailers continue to gain market share," said Michael Niemira, analyst with Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi Ltd. "Even within the Sears report, they talk about the electronics area being one of the stronger areas" while that area was weak for retailers overall."  
Sears, Roebuck and Co was one of the better performers, analysts said. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based retailer said domestic same-store sales rose 9.5 percent.
Sears chairman Arthur Martinez told CNBC that gross margins are very favorable for December and the fourth quarter.
Sears stock was up 1-1/8 at 46-3/8 Thursday. Other gainers included Paul Harris Stores Inc, up 1-7/8 at 20-1/2, Kohl's Corp, up 1-1/4 at 37-3/4, Dayton Hudson Corp up one at 37-3/8 and Saks Holdings Inc up 5/8 at 39-5/8.
