Cathay Pacific chairman Peter Sutch on Monday dug the first turf for the airline's new corporate headquarters in Hong Kong.
"This headquarters... is a firm, visible and concrete example of our commitment to Hong Kong," Sutch told guests and reporters at the huge airport construction site.
The US$448 million or HK$3.5 billion HQ at the territory's Chek Lap Kok airport will house almost all the airline's staff under one roof for the first time. Sutch described the new building as a very important stage in Cathay's 50 year history offering a "home from home" for more than 4,000 employees.
The move to th will open up many new commercial, business and marketing opportunities.
Hank Townsend, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Airport Authority, the body set up to run the new airport assisted at the ceremony.
"We wish you success, luck and great prosperity in the future and welcome you as one of the family, as one of the tenants here at Chek Lap Kok," Townsend said.
The one million square foot complex, being built by Dragages et Travaux Publics (HK) Ltd, part of the French Bouygues Group, includes a 10 storey office block, a 23 storey staff hotel with 350 rooms and a leisure area.
Cathay hopes for savings and improvements in efficiency by not having its staff and 30 department offices spread aronnd Hong Kong. Managers hope to overcome staff concerns about commuting time to the new airport site on Lantau island.
The new airport is due to open in April 1998, and Cathay said its new HQ is due to be completed in August 1998.
