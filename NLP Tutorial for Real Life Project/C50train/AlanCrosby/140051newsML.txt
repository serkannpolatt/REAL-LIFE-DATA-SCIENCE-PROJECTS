The fall in the Czech trade deficit to 10.5 billion crowns in September from 14.5 billion in August buoyed market sentiment, and the goods imported show industrial restructuring is on track, analysts said on Thursday.
Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) data released earlier showed the January-September trade shortfall hit an all-time high of 110.7 billion crowns, far surpassing the full 1995 deficit of 95.7 billion crowns.
But the September shortfall, the smallest one-month deficit this year, surprised analysts, who had forecast on average a gap of 13 to 15 billion crowns.
"I'm happily surprised. I think it's a relatively optimistic figure, though not so good as to make us revise our full year forecast," said Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, which has forecast a 150-160 billion crown deficit at year-end.
The CSU said September imports rose 15.2 percent year-on-year, the same as in August, while exports rose 5.9 percent after a 6.4 percent increase in August.
It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector as these imports are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for export.
The crown also reacted positively, dipping slightly on the release of the figures but quickly regaining its losses as the market digested the statistics.
The crown was trading at 26.939 to the dollar at 0840 GMT after opening at 26.945. The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +2.87 percent, after the central bank's Wednesday fixing at +2.80 percent.
"The market is pleased with the figures for sure, they seem to bear out estimates that slowly, the structure and size of the deficit is getting better," said one local forex dealer.
" don't think the crown itself will benefit too much from the numbers, but it certainly should not weaken," he added.
