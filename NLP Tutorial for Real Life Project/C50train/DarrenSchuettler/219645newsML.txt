Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest bank, joined a once exclusive club on Wednesday, reporting its first C$1 billion annual profit.
The Toronto-based bank said net income jumped 22 percent to C$1.069 billion in the year ended October 31. It also rewarded shareholders with a C$0.03 increase in its quarterly dividend to C$0.37 a share, its second dividend hike of 1996.
"Scotiabank's financial results exceeded our targets once again in 1996," chairman and chief executive Peter Godsoe said in a statement.  
Scotiabank was the fourth of Canada's Big Six banks to break the C$1 billion threshold.
Bank of Montreal posted a record C$1.17 billion profit on Tuesday when it kicked off the Canadian banking group's year-end reporting season.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce joined the club last year, following Royal Bank of Canada in 1994.
Godsoe said all of Scotiabank's main business lines contributed to its record performance, including personal, corporate and investment banking. Improved credit quality also contributed to the bank's bottom line.  
Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 15.8 percent in 1996 from 14.2 percent last year.
The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were slightly better than the average of analysts' estimates.
Earnings rose to C$1.08 a share in the three months ended October 31 from C$0.88 in the same period in 1995.
The consensus forecast from analysts was C$1.05 or C$1.06 a share. "They are strong and probably surprising," one industry analyst said.
Other analysts said the results were in line with their expectations.  
Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp, had forecast C$1.08 per share in the fourth quarter.
"They were right in line," Cohen said, adding that the bank's loan losses and the dividend increase were expected.
Scotiabank stock rose 0.30 to 46.15 in mid-afternoon turnover of 402,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Among other financial highlights:
* Net interest income rose 15 percent to C$3.58 billion in 1996, due mostly to strong growth in earning assets across all business lines. The bank also posted securities gains of C$129 million in 1996, versus gains of C$38 million in 1995.  
The cost of funding impaired loans also fell due to lower interest rates and a drop in the level of impaired loans.
* Other income jumped 14 percent to C$1.78 billion in 1996. The bank attributed the increase to stronger revenues from electronic and card services and higher loan fees.
With financial markets enjoying a prolonged rally in 1996, the bank's full service and discount brokerage operations posted a 50 percent jump in revenues.
* Non-interest expenses grew by 13 percent to C$3.22 billion, due mostly to performance related compensation and higher business volumes.  
* Net impaired loans fell 49 percent to C$743 million in 1996. Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances improved to 0.7 percent, their lowest since 1989.
* Provision for credit losses dropped to C$380 million in 1996, down from C$560 million last year. The bank's general provision remained at C$325 million.
