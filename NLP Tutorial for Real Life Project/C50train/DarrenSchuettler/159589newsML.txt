Toronto stocks ended weaker amid profit taking on Friday, but not before Canada's biggest stock market had struggled to a new intraday high.
The TSE 300 Composite Index fell 7.51 points to close at 5591.31 in brisk turnover of 90.4 million shares valued at C$1.47 billion ($1.1 billion).
Declining stocks outpaced advances 473 to 435 with 289 issues unchanged.
"The story today was profit-taking," said Ira Katzin, an investment adviser with RBC Dominion Securities. The TSE posted its 50th record close on Thursday and also broke through the key 5600 barrier.
The TSE managed to hit an intraday high of 5606 before turning lower on the day.
Toronto's nine weak sectors included sharp losses in consumer products, base metals, communications and pipelines.
The five strong groups were led by financial services. Bank stocks rallied along with firmer North American bond markets and on expectations for another Bank of Canada rate cut next weak.
Analysts said the strong Canadian dollar has given the central bank enough leeway to lower rates.
The Canadian currency closed stronger at C$1.3335 (US$0.7499) on Friday, the strongest the unit has been since October, 1995.
