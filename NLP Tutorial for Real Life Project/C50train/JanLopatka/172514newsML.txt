Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced a state commission on Wednesday to attack bureaucracy in the land of Franz Kafka.
It will have a steering committee, a chairman, two vice-chairmen, two sections, six sub-commissions and more members than Klaus's cabinet.
But Klaus denied suggestions that the new "Commission for the Removal of Bureaucratic Burden" would pour fuel on to the fire, telling a news conference that the only bureaucrat working at the commission would be a secretary.
The other staff, numbering around 20, would perform their duties part time, said Klaus, whose cabinet has 16 members.
The Czech bureaucracy, crafted by the Austro-Hungarian empire and perfected under communism, inflicts daily misery on local and foreign residents alike.
Franz Kafka, the Prague novellist of the early 20th century, wrote of angst born of bureaucracy in such works as "The Trial" and "The Castle".
Things today do not seem much better. Applications for documents such as company registrations, licences and work permits can take weeks or months to process.
They can involve repeated visits to offices where citizens have to queue patiently sometimes for hours waiting to be summoned by often surly bureaucrats. Knocking on office doors for attention is strictly forbidden.
Klaus said the commission should aim to simplify issues like setting up a business, getting construction permits or social benefits, or dealing with tax offices.
Chairman Vladimir Budinsky, a former transport minister, indicated he was confident his commission would not gain the Czech bureaucrat's reputation for idleness.
"I believe that we will be able to find people for each section who would be ready to work," he said.
