Volkswagen AG Czech unit Skoda Auto a.s. said on Monday its new mid-sized "Octavia" sedan will list on its home market at a base price of 335,700 crowns ($12,800), at the low end of its class.
At a media presentation at the plant north of Prague, marketing chief Detlef Wittig said Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias next year, and raise production to 90,000 in 1998.
The new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, will be available with three petrol and two diesel engines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns.
The Octavia will get its international test at the Paris International Auto Show in October and should be delivered to Czech dealers in November, followed by launches on foreign markets where prices have yet to be determined.
Skoda was taken over by Volkswagen in 1992 under a government privatisation plan. The company built an entirely new factory for Octavia production.
Continuing the break from the boxy communist-era Skodas, the Octavia has more modern but conservative lines, somewhere between a Ford Mondeo and Audi's A-line.
Skoda is hoping to build on the success of its Felicia economy five-door hatchback by offering an affordable middle-range sedan and take back chunks of its home market lost to Czechs seeking a more western-looking status symbol.
"Octavia... is a logical step from Felicia into a higher market segment," said Wittig.
The cheapest Octavia includes a 1.6 litre, 55 Kw engine, ignition immobiliser, driver-side airbag, plus an adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel.
More expensive versions will be alternatively equipped with a 1.6/74 kw, 20-valve 1.8/92 kw engine, 1.9/66 kw turbodiesel or 1.9/50 kw diesel engine, and an optional passenger-side airbag.
Side-body airbags should be available in mid-1997.
Wittig told reporters that Octavia should help Skoda's total production to rise to 350,000 units next year and 400,000 at the turn of the century after 251,000 cars made this year.
"Within the (VW) concern, Skoda takes the position of the counterweight to the Asian producers," he added.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said that he expected about 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the domestic market, the rest being exported to the rest of Europe and overseas.
The company lost 1.621 billion crowns last year due to heavy investments into the new factory, but Kalma said the firm should come close to breaking even this year.
