Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Richard Krajicek crashed out of the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Tuesday, losing 6-4 6-3 to Germany's David Prinosil.
Second seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also had a rough ride but eventually overcame Italy's Renzo Furlan 7-5 4-6 6-3 while sixth seed Michael Stich of Germany cruised past Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6 6-2.
Krajicek, whose parents emigrated from then Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands when he was a child, struggled to bring his booming serve under control from the outset, failing to mount a sustained attack against Prinosil, ranked number 58 in the world.
"I'm not very happy with the way I played, and David returned my serve very well, and my second serve was off," said Krajicek who served up only seven aces and six double faults.
Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich found the going much easier, taking a close first set before overpowering world number 71 Stolle in the second set.
After crashing out of the first round in each of his last two tournaments, world number seven Ferreira looked shaky at times, committing a rash of unforced errors that left the match even after two sets.
But another early exit for the South African would have seriously jeopardised his chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany at the end of the year.
"It's always a tough match against Renzo, he has a game that is suited well against mine," said Ferreira, who currently holds the eighth and final spot for Hanover with Boris Becker, scheduled to play in Ostrava on Wednesday, just 46 points behind.
Fifth seed Todd Martin easily disposed of Slovakia's Jan Kroslak 6-3 6-4 and eighth seed Bohdan Ulihrach fought back in the last set to defeat his Czech Davis Cup team mate Daniel Vacek 6-2 3-6 7-5.
