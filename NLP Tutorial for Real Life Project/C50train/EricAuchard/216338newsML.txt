More than $1 billion in royalty payments to Texas Instruments Inc from Samsung Electric Co Ltd will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business.
But while the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on the additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995.
The stock, which gained 4-3/8 to 60-7/8 by late Wednesday, was among the most actively traded stock on the NYSE.  
Earlier, Texas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it more than $1 billion as part of a 10-year technology cross-licensing pact. In exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other.
"Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement," Merrill Lynch analyst Tom Kurlak said, referring to the royalty formula for Samsung to pay Texas Instruments.
"Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them," Kurlak said. The analyst maintained an attractive rating on the stock.
