Westpac Banking Corp said on Wednesday it expected rapid revenue growth from the alliance it had formed with Standard Chartered Bank Plc for banking services in Asia.
"We expect it to be a fairly rapidly growing revenue stream," said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac's Institutional and International Banking Group.  
However, Morgan said he could not say how much revenue the alliance would produce in its first year of business or how much Westpac had invested in the venture, which officially started on Wednesday.
The banks said earlier there would be no exchange of equity between the two.
"We have made a substantial investment already, but it is going to be a continuing investment as we expand our capabilities across Asia," Morgan told Reuters by telephone.  
Westpac has no plans to extend the alliance beyond Asia to the Middle East and Africa, where Standard Chartered also has operations.
"We are going to purely focus it on Asia," Morgan said.
The venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, Morgan said.
