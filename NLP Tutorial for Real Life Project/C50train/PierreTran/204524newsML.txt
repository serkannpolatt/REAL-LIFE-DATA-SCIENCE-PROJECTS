State-owned Air France on Wednesday reported dramatically improved earnings of 802 million francs ($158 million) in the first half and placed a bumper order for 20 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, plus options.
The profit estimate for the six months to September 30, which emerged in an Air France board statement, compared with a loss of 335 million francs a year ago.
The improved results and Air France's aim to break even in 1996/97 was underlined with orders for 10 Boeing 777 twinjets, and options for 10 more. The airline also ordered five Airbus A340s, confirmed five orders made in June and options for a further five.
Air France chairman Christian Blanc won vital support from Prime Minister Alain Juppe to buy from Seattle-based Boeing instead of ordering solely from its archrival Airbus Industrie , the European consortium based in southwest France.
At catalogue prices, which are rarely paid, the orders and options for the Boeing 777-200 version ordered could be worth around $2.7 billion. Airbus would stand to gain $1.75 billion.
List prices for the B777-200 range between $128 and $146 million, while the Airbus A340-300 costs $110 to $120 million.
"In the reorganisation of its fleet, Air France is obliged to buy Boeing," Transport Minister Bernard Pons told parliament.
"It is obliged to meet commitments made in 1989, unless it accepts losing deposits and taking legal action which risks being much more expensive than taking this decision."
The French airline had orders outstanding with Boeing worth $994 million and $2 billion of options, Pons said, adding that the airline had skillfully negotiated the latest order to respect the initial undertaking.
The three state representatives on the Air France board approved the Boeing 777 purchase "not because they are the best or the most profitable but because they best meet the company's needs," Pons said.
Air France had also accepted to be a launch customer for the planned A340-600, a "stretched" version of the A340, he said.
Airbus hopes to build the 375-seater to smash Boeing's monopoly at the large capacity aircraft segment.
Air France said that due to financial problems, it froze at the end of 1994 all aircraft orders, including the 1989 Boeing order, and opened talks with the two plane-makers.
Air France has since rationalised its fleet, restructured its network around a centralised "hub" at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport and optimised aircraft use. It has over the past two years increased the number of flying hours by 14 percent.
Pons welcomed Air France's financial results, saying: "The results are very encouraging."
The company said it made its profit despite a rise in spending on fuel of nearly 500 million francs for the period.
Turnover was up nearly five percent to 21.3 billion francs due to a 14.8 percent increase in passenger traffic and a 6.7 percent rise in freight.
Operating profit rose nearly 30 percent to 1.1 billion francs, compared with 849 million in the year-earlier period. The pretax, pre-exceptional result tripled to 660 million francs.
Air France was ahead by "a little more than 250 million francs of its budget" at the six months stage, the company said. The first half is traditionally better for seasonal reasons and should not be used to extrapolate for the full year, it added.
Debt stood at 12.9 billion francs at September 30, versus 19.2 billion at March 31, 1996. The repayment of 6.3 billion francs significantly exceeded the last tranche of its state recapitalisation paid in September.
The Boeing order consists of the heavier "Increased Gross Weight" version of the basic 777-200, equipped with GE90 engines built by General Electric and France's Snecma. The B777-200 will seat 288 passengers in three-classes.
The Airbus order is for the A340-200E version equipped with CFM56-5C4 engines. ($1=5.075 French Franc)
