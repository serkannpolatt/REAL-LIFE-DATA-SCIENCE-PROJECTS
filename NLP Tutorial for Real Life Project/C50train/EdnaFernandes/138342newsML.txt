Smiths Industries Plc said on Wednesday that its $30 million acquisition of Leland Electrosystems Inc of the U.S. offered a perfect product fit and access to major military aircraft supply contracts.
Leland is an electrical power generator manufacturer for military and civil aircraft. It has a key U.S. position to supply the F18 military aircraft which is the principal U.S. fighter jet.
It has also secured an order to supply the new version of the F18, involving 1,000 aircraft.  
Russell Plumley, director of public affairs, told Reuters in an interview that Leland's contract for these military aircraft alone involved "very substantial sums. Tens of millions of dollars over a five to six year period."
The smaller civil aviation side of the business includes a contract to provide generators for the 777 commercial aircraft. Smiths also services the F18 and 777 aircraft in other product areas, he said.
The Leland deal will be earnings enhancing in the first full year after acquisition. But Smiths said it would not be implementing job cuts or cost cutting.
