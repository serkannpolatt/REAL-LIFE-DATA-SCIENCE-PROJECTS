Air France on Wednesday ordered 10 Boeing jetliners and 10 Airbus jets, and the government-owned airline reported dramatically improved profits of 802 million francs ($158 million) in the first half.
The profit estimate for the six months ending Sept. 30, disclosed in an Air France board statement, compared with a loss of 335 million francs ($66 million) a year ago.
The improved results and Air France's aim to break even in 1996/97 was underlined by the orders for 10 Boeing 777 twinjets and options for 10 more. The airline also ordered five Airbus A340s, confirmed five orders made in June and took options for an additional five.
Air France Chairman Christian Blanc won vital support from French Prime Minister Alain Juppe to buy from Seattle-based Boeing instead of ordering solely from its archrival Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in southwest France.
At list prices, which are rarely paid, the orders and options for the Boeing 777-200 version ordered could be worth around $2.7 billion. Airbus would stand to gain $1.75 billion.
List prices for the B777-200 range between $128 million and $146 million, while the Airbus A340-300 costs $110 million to $120 million.
"In the reorganization of its fleet, Air France is obliged to buy Boeing," Transport Minister Bernard Pons told parliament.
"It is obliged to meet commitments made in 1989 unless it accepts losing deposits and taking legal action, which risks being much more expensive than making this decision."
The French airline had outstanding Boeing orders worth $994 million and $2 billion in options, Pons said, adding that the airline had skilfully negotiated the latest order to respect the initial commitment.
The three government representatives on the Air France board approved the Boeing 777 purchase "not because they are the best or the most profitable but because they best meet the company's needs," Pons said.
Air France had also accepted to be a launch customer for the planned A340-600, a "stretched" version of the A340, he said.
Airbus hopes to build the 375-seater to smash Boeing's monopoly in the large-capacity aircraft segment.
Air France said that, due to financial problems, it froze at the end of 1994 all aircraft orders, including the 1989 Boeing order, and opened talks with the two plane makers.
Air France has since reorganized its fleet, restructured its network around a centralized "hub" at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport and optimised aircraft use. It has over the past two years increased the number of flying hours by 14 percent.
Pons welcomed Air France's financial results, saying: "The results are very encouraging."
