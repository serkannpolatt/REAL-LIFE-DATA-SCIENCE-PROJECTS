# Video notebooks

These notebooks are the exact notebooks created during the video recordings of each section.

Each section is numbered accordingly.

For example, `00_pytorch_fundamentals_video.ipynb` is the video version of the original notebook `00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb`.

The ground truth notebooks (the notebooks these are based off) are available at [learnpytorch.io](https://learnpytorch.io).
