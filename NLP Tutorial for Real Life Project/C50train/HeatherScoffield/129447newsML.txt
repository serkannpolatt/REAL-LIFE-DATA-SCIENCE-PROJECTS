Poor metal prices hurt earnings at Canadian base metal miners in the third quarter, with profits down at Inco Ltd., Falconbridge Ltd. and Cominco Ltd.
Nickel giant Inco said on Monday its third-quarter profit fell to $29 million, or 19 cents a share, from $44 million or 33 cents a share a year earlier. The earnings per share for the 1996 third quarter were worse due partly to shares issued in the takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc.
Inco's rival, Falconbridge, earned $30.1 million ($22.3 million) or C17 cents (13 cents) a share excluding extraordinary gains, a steep drop from last year's C$84.5 million ($62.7 million) or C47 cents (35 cents) a share.
Vancouver-based Cominco, which produces zinc, nickel, copper and other metals, said earnings were C$5.2 million ($3.86 million) or C6 cents (4 cents) a share, down sharply from C$22 million ($16.4 million) or C25 cents (19 cents) a share last year.
All three cited copper as the main culprit.
The average price for copper on the London Metal Exchange in the third quarter was 90 cents a pound, vs. $1.37 at the same time last year, Cominco said.
The copper price plummeted in June after a copper scandal at Japanese metals giant Sumitomo Corp. The red metal has just begun to regain some of its strength.
All three companies also pointed to lower nickel prices as a major source of weakness in the third quarter.
The average nickel price for the quarter fell to $3.26 a pound from $3.92 at the same time last year, Cominco said.
Analysts said investors were now taking advantage of the lower stock prices to buy more shares.
Inco rose C$1.15 to C$41.90 in Toronto and by $1 to $31.125 in New York in late afternoon trading on Monday. Falconbridge rose 75 cents to C$29 ($21.48) and Cominco gained C45 cents to C$30.65 ($22.70) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Copper and nickel have strengthened recently, putting a shine on the fourth quarter, said mining analyst Tony Hayes at the Credifinance brokerage.
"I'm astounded that copper has not already risen. It will go very rapidly when it does move."
