It's a Snip, bidding to become the ninth horse to win two years in succession in the 106-year history of the Pardubice steeplechase, leads a British raid to this city east of Prague on Sunday.
Last year's winner, one of a trio of British horses expected for the controversial four-and-a-quarter mile event (6.9 km), has the considerable advantage from the saddle of Richard Dunwoody, one of the world's most accomplished jump jockeys.
The Pardubice, a unique test of man and horse, includes a series of demanding obstacles and has been compared to the Grand National at Aintree, a race Dunwoody has won twice.
Race organisers have made the course easier in recent years, including modifying the daunting Taxis jump with its tough, high, wide fence and deep ditch. 
This and various other changes among the other 30 jumps followed massive protests and the embarassing 1993 outcome when only one horse managed to finish.
A total of 21 horses have died in the Pardubice over the years.
Rounding out the trio of British challengers looking to win part of the 2.5 million crown ($92,000) purse are Irish Stamp and Veleda II.
Irish Stamp, to be ridden by Norman Williamson, has a clear chance and is rated considerably higher in England than It's a Snip, although the latter's proven ability over the course will be a major factor.
Of the others, Polish-trained Scater is also expected to make a bold show.
Despite its long history, the Pardubice has only recently regained its former status.
"In the past everyone in Britain knew of the enormously difficult course but they didn't have much interest," said Nigel Miller, one of the organisers who has worked to bring the British contingent here.
"But this year, one of the biggest hits of the season is to come here for a two-day trip to one of the most historic races around."
