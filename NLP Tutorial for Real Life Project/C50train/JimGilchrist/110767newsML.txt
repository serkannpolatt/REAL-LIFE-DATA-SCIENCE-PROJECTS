Virgin Atlantic Airways said it is considering replacing its Airbus Industrie A340 aircraft with higher capacity Boeing Co 747-400s because of high demand between Hong Kong and London.
But aircraft availability and scheduling preclude an immediate change, David Woodward, general manager commercial for the Virgin Atlantic Cargo division said in a statement.
"The Hong Kong service has been highly successful, in fact we have suffered too little capacity. There is a possibility though of the aircraft change happening in the near future," he added.
Another senior Virgin executive said earlier this year that the carrier was hoping to increase its daily flights from Hong Kong to London to 10 a week.
He also said Virgin has plans to start a London to Shanghai service.
Industry observers say lack of slots at the territory's overcrowded airport is thought to be a big stumbling block and larger aircraft would be a short-term solution until Hong Kong's new airport opens.
Virgin's assistant manager in Hong Kong, Brinkley Chan said there has been no progress on a proposal to add a freighter to its fleet because of low market rates between Hong Kong and Europe and low yields.
