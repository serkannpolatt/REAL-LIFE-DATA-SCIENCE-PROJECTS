All exercise notebooks for the PyTorch deep learning teaching materials. 

You can see example solutions in the [solutions folder](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/extras/solutions) (but you should try the exercises yourself first!).

**Note:** There may be more than one way of creating a solution for each exercise, this is not a bug, give it a go and see what happens.
