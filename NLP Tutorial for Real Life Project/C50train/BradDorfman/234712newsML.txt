Freight hauler Yellow Corp. said Wednesday it could cut 1 percent to 2 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring of its largest operating unit, Yellow Freight System.
Overland Park, Kan.-based Yellow Corp. said it has offered early retirement to 153 employees who are 55 and older and that it will announce layoffs in the first quarter.
The company also said it will take an unspecified charge to fourth quarter earnings to cover expenses resulting from early retirement, severance and other costs related to a reorganization of Yellow Freight along geographic lines.
Each geographic unit will have a group vice president who reports to Yellow Freight President Bill Zollars, while five officers at the central office will also report to Zollars, the company said.
"We are decentralizing responsibility for the business processes that touch the customer in an effort to be more responsive to their LTL needs," Zollars said of the less-than-truckload freight hauling business.
"All members of the leadership and management teams will be focused and incentive-based on four priorities," said Zollars. "Those areas are customer satisfaction, improved profitability, revenue growth and operating safely."
Employees will have until Jan. 15 to make their decisions on whether to take early retirement, Yellow said.
The number of layoffs will be determined, in part, based on the early retirement decisions, as well as the needs of the company as it reorganizes, a spokesman said. He estimated about 1 percent to 2 percent of Yellow's 24,700 employees could be affected.
Analysts said the moves announced Wednesday were part of a strategy to improve performance at Yellow and help it regain market share.
"I think they need to focus on some labour productivity," said Corina Bergschneider, analyst at George K. Baum &amp; Co. "Obviously, that needs to be done in line with their union contract and what can be allowed."
Yellow shares fell 12.5 cents to $14.50 on the Nasdaq system.
