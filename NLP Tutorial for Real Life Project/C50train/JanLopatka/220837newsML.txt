Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Wednesday said the government had approved a plan to privatise at least part of the state's 31.5 percent stake in commercial bank IPB a.s..
Speaking after the government's regular weekly session, Klaus said he had charged Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik with the task of setting conditions for a tender to sell the stake.
He added that no decision on a central bank proposal to merge banks CSOB a.s. and Ceska Sporitelna a.s. had been taken, though the government remained committed to privatising its holdings in the country's four biggest banks.
"He (Kocarnik) is due to submit to the cabinet, in cooperation with a chosen consultancy firm, the criteria for the selection of a strategic foreign partner," Klaus said.
Representatives from the state privatisation agency, the National Property Fund (NPF), and the central bank would also be involved in the process of developing the tender.
"The intention is for Mr Kocarnik to come up with the criteria as soon as possible," Klaus said.
Klaus did not say how much of the government's stake would be included in the sale to a strategic foreign partner.
Japan's Nomura and Dutch banks ING and ABN AMRO have been widely reported as expressing an interest in the IPB stake.
The central bank has submitted a plan to the cabinet proposing a merger of CSOB, where the Czech government holds 66 percent, and Ceska Sporitelna where it has 45 percent, but Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has reacted coolly to the idea.
"We did not make any fundamental judgements on mergers today," Klaus said. He did not elaborate.
A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna would create post-Communist Europe's largest bank with assets topping $20 billion.
Klaus added that the privatisation of CSOB, which is wholly-owned by Czech and Slovak state institutions, and the selloff of Komercni Banka were complicated because of shareholdings and arrangements between the banks and Slovakia.
